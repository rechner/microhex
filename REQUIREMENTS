Currently Microhex requires:
    - Python version 3.2 or greater (http://python.org/download)
    - C preprocessor (cpp) tool (optional, required for parsing data type definitions from C-language headers). Comes
      with most of C or C++ compilers.
    - Qt version 4.8.x or greater (http://qt-project.org/downloads). Note that Qt 5 is not supported yet.
    - PyQt (based on Qt 4.8 or greater, but not Qt 5.x) (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)
    - pycparser Python module (optional, required for parsing data type definitions from C-language headers)
      For Ubuntu, you should install python3-pycparser package or use pip.

If you are using binary installer for Windows, you have not to care about these dependencies as installer will
care about it for you.

The following libraries and application are only required if you are building Microhex from sources, binary installation
does not require it.
    - gcc or MinGW C++ compiler with support for C++11 standard (g++ version 4.6 or greater)
      (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw)
    - SIP bindings generator (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download)
