Before building application, make sure that all required programs and components are installed on your
system. Currently Microhex requires:
    - Python version 3.2 or greater (http://python.org/download)
    - Qt version 4.8.x or greater (http://qt-project.org/downloads)
    - PyQt (based on Qt 4.8 or greater, but not Qt 5.x) (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)
    - gcc or MinGW C++ compiler with support for C++11 standard (g++ version 4.6 or greater)
      (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw)
    - SIP bindings generator (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download)

Next step is to set proper values in config.pri file.
Note for Linux users: beware of installing application into /usr/bin (or another
system directory) as it can lead to problems when you want to uninstall software. Instead of this, use a package
manager (if you are reading this text in far future and i had made package for your favourite distro ;) ) or install
Microhex into your profile directory and create soft link in /usr/bin pointing to installed microhex.py.

Open a console in source root directory. If you want to compile all available translations, run the following command:
    lrelease microhex.pro
or go to src/translations directory and compile only desired translation files.

And final step. To build and install application, run following commands:
    mkdir build && cd build
    qmake ..
    make install
Depending on system configuration, last command may be different (for example, mingw32-make if you are using MinGW).

After all, you can start Microhex by executing command in installation directory:
    python3 ./microhex.py
or by double-clicking on microhex.py icon if you are using Windows and .py files are associated with Python 3.x
interpreter.
