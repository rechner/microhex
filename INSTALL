Before building application, make sure that all required programs and components are installed on your
system. See REQUIREMENTS file for details.

Next step is to set proper values in config.pri file. Here you should adjust paths to tool used by build system and
set directory where Microhex files will be installed.
Note for Linux users: beware of installing application into /usr/bin (or another system directory) as it can lead
to problems when uninstalling software. Instead of this, use a package manager (if you are reading this text in
far future and i had made package for your favourite distro ;) ) or install Microhex into your profile directory
and create soft link in /usr/bin pointing to installed microhex.py.

Next step is to compile translation files. If you only need English, you can skip this step.
Open a console in source root directory. If you want to compile all available translations, run the following command:
    lrelease microhex.pro
or go to src/translations directory and compile only desired translation files by running
    lrelease TRANSLATION_FILE
where TRANSLATION_FILE is one of translation files (*.ts) provided with application.

Final step. Open a console in source root directory (where 'docs' and 'src' directories are located).
Run following commands:
    mkdir build && cd build
    qmake ..
    make install
Depending on system configuration, last command may be different (for example, mingw32-make if you are using MinGW).
After installation is complete, you can safely remove created 'build' directory with temporary files.

Now you can start Microhex by executing command in directory where Microhex had been installed:
    python3 ./microhex.py
or by double-clicking on microhex.py icon if you are using Windows and .py files are associated with Python 3.x
interpreter.
