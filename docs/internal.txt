1. There is bug in sip (or PyQt, or both) due to which integer values are processed incorrectly - positive
   values that are too big for int are trimmed and treated as negative (even if C++ type is unsigned).
   This behaviour affects values returned from __len__ attribute implementation generated for wrapped C++ code
   as well as Python values that are passed through signals. Fortunately, values returned from wrapped C++
   function or plain variables are not affected (values from signal that was emitted in C++ are correct too).
   Workaround is not to use __len__ in sip, and replace 'int' with 'object' in calls to pyqtSignal if integer
   value can be too big.
