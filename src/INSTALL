Ensure that Python 3.3 or greater and PyQt4 (based on Qt 4.8 or greater, but not Qt5) is installed
on your system. On Linux, you should refer to distribution manuals to find out which packages are
required (for example, on Ubuntu you should install python3 and python3-pyqt4 packages).
If Windows is your OS of choice, you can download Python from official site:
....http://python.org/download
and PyQt from here:
....http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

After all requirements are met, go to "src" subdirectory of Microhex and run the following command in terminal:
....python3 ./build.py ./

Now you can run Microhex application with:
....python3 ./run.py
